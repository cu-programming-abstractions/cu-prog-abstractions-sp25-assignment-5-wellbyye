Q1.
Starting with an empty table of 10 slots (0 to 9), we insert the numbers one by one:
- 31 hashes to 1 (last digit 1), so slot 1 gets 31.
- 41 hashes to 1, but slot 1 is taken, so we try slot 2, which is empty, so 41 goes there.
- 59 hashes to 9, slot 9 is empty, so 59 goes in slot 9.
- 26 hashes to 6, slot 6 is empty, so 26 goes there.
- 53 hashes to 3, slot 3 is empty, so 53 goes there.
- 58 hashes to 8, slot 8 is empty, so 58 goes there.
- 97 hashes to 7, slot 7 is empty, so 97 goes there.
- 93 hashes to 3, but slot 3 has 53, so we check slot 4, which is empty, so 93 goes there.

The table looks like this:
0: .
1: 31
2: 41
3: 53
4: 93
5: .
6: 26
7: 97
8: 58
9: 59

Q2.
We inserted 8 elements into a table with 10 slots, so the load factor α = 8/10 = 0.8.

Q3.
Yes, it’s possible to get a different table by inserting the same elements in a different order. For example, if we insert 58 before 53 and 93, the collisions and probing steps will change, leading to a different arrangement. So the order of insertion definitely affects the final table.

Q4.
To check if 72 is in the table from Q1, we hash 72 to slot 2 (last digit 2).
- Slot 2 has 41, not 72, so we check the next slot 3, which has 53, not 72.
- Then slot 4 has 93, not 72.
- Slot 5 is empty, so we stop searching.
So we look at slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Q5.
To check for 137, hash 137 to slot 7.
- Slot 7 has 97, not 137, check slot 8: 58, not 137.
- Slot 9: 59, no.
- Slot 0: empty (.), so we stop.
Slots checked: 7, 8, 9, 0.

Q6.
Removing 41 (at slot 2) and 53 (at slot 3) with tombstones means we mark those slots with 'T' instead of empty:

0: .
1: 31
2: T
3: T
4: 93
5: .
6: 26
7: 97
8: 58
9: 59

Q7.
Insert 106, 107, and 110 into the table with tombstones:
- 106 hashes to 6, slot 6 has 26, move to 7: 97, 8: 58, 9: 59, 0: . So 0 is free, but before that, tombstones are at 2 and 3. We insert 106 at slot 2 (replacing tombstone).
- 107 hashes to 7, slots 7,8,9,0 checked already. Slot 1 has 31, so next is slot 2 (now 106), slot 3 is tombstone, so insert 107 at slot 3.
- 110 hashes to 0, slot 0 is free, so 110 goes there.

Final table:
0: 110
1: 31
2: 106
3: 107
4: 93
5: .
6: 26
7: 97
8: 58
9: 59
